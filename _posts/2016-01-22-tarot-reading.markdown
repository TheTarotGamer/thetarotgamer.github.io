I was recently invited to become a moderator for a group called BoneAndStone on
Reddit. I make a few announcements here about my new moderator position, show
off my new camera a little, and conduct two tarot card readings. I had a lot of
fun doing this one and I am really excited about my new camera. I think the
quality of the video is much improved.
