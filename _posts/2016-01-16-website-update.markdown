The new website is coming along nicely. I have integrated a calendar watching
system that works off of Google Calendar. This will allow me to schedule shows
and events and have them reflect on the site instantly. Some people may not
know but the hosting for this site uses something called a 'static site
generator'. This has both positives as well as negatives.

Some of the positives include increased security, no need to update databases,
and a much reduced threat foot print. It is much more hands off once it is up
and running since you don't need to worry about keeping packages and tools and
blogging software up to date.

Another positive that GitHub pages provides is monetary. It doesn't cost
anything to host a website with GitHub. I priced out some hosting and more
places are going to charge anywhere from $5 to $50 per month to host your
website, do updates, and manage your web presence. That is a lot of money for
someone who is running a YouTube channel for fun.

The negatives to using this are not that bad. There is a learning curve to
using a tool set like this. Not every one is going to be able to easily leap
into building a site using GitHub and their Pages system. It is also difficult
to move away from having a database. When I was using WordPress it was much
easier to simply save information to the database, use templates and plugins,
and build using those tools. GitHub pages takes more creativity and outside
assistance.

Images have to be hosted by SOMEONE. I am using imgur for my image hosting.
There aren't any images on the site yet but there will be. When I start adding
more, I will add them to the imgur hosting account and then link them here.
You have to be a little more reliant on outside sources for hosting things for
you if you aren't handling them all yourself.

The last item I am going to talk about is my new disqus account. I added
comments to GitHub Pages by including the disqus and checking to see if the
post has comments enabled. I enable comments by adding the variable 'comments'
to the post yaml. If this sounds like Greek, I understand. It's not
particularly important but I found it to be useful and fun.
