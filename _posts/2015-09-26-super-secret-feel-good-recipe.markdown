# I have been sick.

I decided I would make a simple post about something that I drink when I feel
bad. Are you ready for my super secret recipe?

## Recipe
- Hot Water
- Lemon Juice / Fresh Squeeze Lemon
- Honey from a local source

Boil some water in a pot and then mix up some honey and lemon juice in a cup. I
recommend using locally sourced honey because the bees will make honey with
local plants. It's good for you. It's super easy and really basic but you would
be surprised how good it will make you feel when you have a sore throat.

So there. I have revealed my ultra super secret potion recipe. Enjoy. Don't
burn yourself.
