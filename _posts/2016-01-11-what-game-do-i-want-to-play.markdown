# Picking Games To Play

I have decided to get into streaming, blogging, podcasting, and doing tarot
again. I want to spend each evening working on my little project so I decided
it was time to pick a game I could play when I am streaming. The game I chose
is called [Xonotic][xonotic_home] and it is Open Source.

[Xonotic][xonotic_home] is a fast paced Quake Arena clone that is available for
Linux, Mac, and Windows. I have been playing it for a few hours and I found it
to be really enjoyable. The game itself is a little frantic, a little nostalgia
inducing, and really really fun.

I don't know if people will enjoy watching me play it, but I enjoy playing it
and I think that is what is going to count. I have also started to make a
potential list of other games and I think I can stream with my PS4 as well. I
need to check to see if I am going to need to get a Playstation Network
account. I may need one and that is going to be an expense I need to prepare
for. I suppose I will find out.

See you all soon!
