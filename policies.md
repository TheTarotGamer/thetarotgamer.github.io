#TheTarotGamer Privacy Policy

TheTarotGamer publishes videos of tarot card readings. We will use a nickname
or the user name of the individual we are doing a tarot reading for unless
otherwise asked to not do so. Your user name or nickname will be linked to a
time stamp in a video or otherwise posted when publishing the tarot reading.

If you need your information redacted from a reading, please contact
TheTarotGamer to discuss the issue. We will not be held responsible for any
issues or events that arise from you deciding to get a tarot reading and your
nickname or user name being posted to our site or affiliate sites.
